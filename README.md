# OOP SVG Logo Maker
## Description
The purpose of this app was to let a user create a custom SVG monogram logo in three possible shapes by prompting the user with questions and then writing a new SVG file.
## Challenges
I found this assignment very difficult and was not able to make it function correctly.  It creates the logo file and renders part of it but gets some errors that I had trouble solving.  I hope I can come back to this one as time allows because I think I was very close.
## Dependencies
You need to have installed Inquirer 8.2.4 and Jest 29.4.3
## How to Run
Clone the repo, open a terminal, install all dependencies, and run "node index.js"
